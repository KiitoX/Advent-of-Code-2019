Quick Overview
--------------

This was developed on Linux, and I haven't tested compatibility with Windows.

Every day is contained in one file with one function to run all necessary routines, things that are reused are in separate files.

Everything is tested to have no Valgrind memory leak warnings.

Sadly I didn't have much time or energy, so I didn't get very far.
